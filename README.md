# cards-against-humanity-api

A simple Cards Against Humanity API built with Node.js.

This is an educational project. You're free to do whatever you want with this.

A separate version of this API hosted on Firebase is available [here](https://github.com/greencoast-studios/firebase-cards-against-humanity-api).

The API above is a bit different than this one, the routes are a bit different and the random endpoint is no longer available.
